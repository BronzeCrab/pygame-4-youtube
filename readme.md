## what is it?

This is small 2d pygame game. This is indeed very cool
game tbh, just try it, and you will not regret.

## how to run it:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```

## how to play:

### First lvl:

You can control your character using WASD.

You must kill all mobs (by pushing or pulling boxes) in order to win at first lvl. You can push any amount of boxes in front of you. Also, you can pull only one box if you hold left ctrl btn.

### Second lvl:

You must also kill all monsters. You can use boxes, as in the first lvl, but also you can pick up the sword, and use it pressing space btn.
